Sustainability Report 2018   MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR OF SUSTAINABILITY  Dear Stakeholder, Global megatrends, such as climate change, scarcity of resources, population growth, acceleration of urbanisation, changes in global economic power and technological advances, are changing the way that organisations, industries and society interact. Corticeira Amorim is no exception. In this ever-changing world, our choices and actions must increasingly be aligned with the actual capacities of Planet Earth, our common home, and the absolute necessity to promote global sustainable and inclusive development, eradicating the abysmal asymmetries that currently exist. At Corticeira Amorim we have always assumed a ï¬rm commitment to developing resourceeï¬ƒcient products and solutions, produced in a sustainable manner and based on a sustainable raw material â€“ cork. But we always want to go further. There are research, development and innovation projects that allow us to oï¬€er a portfolio of products and solutions that achieve their functions in an irreproachable way, oï¬€ering incomparable advantages: they reduce the carbon footprint of the ï¬nal product, save energy or water, clean the environment, improve indoor air quality, and foster well-being and comfort. We therefore believe that our eï¬€orts contribute to the Agenda 2030 and to the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). One of the key highlights of 2018 was the conï¬rmation of the sustainability credentials of the Neutrocork stopper, a latest generation cork stopper, which guarantees excellent quality with a signiï¬cant positive impact on the environment. And also WISE, the ï¬rst generation of Amorim-branded ï¬‚ooring, that is a totally PVC-free, a carbon-negative product that incorporates cork and recycled materials. Over the past year, following an unprecedented stakeholders consultation process, we reviewed our sustainable development strategy and identiï¬ed priority targets aligned with the SDGs. We underscored our contribution to integrating the values of ecosystems and biodiversity through the ongoing Forestry Intervention Project that over the coming years will foster, the planting of 50 thousand hectares of cork oak forest, with greater density and productivity than the traditional montado (cork oak forest); and to protect labour rights and promote safe and secure workplaces we set the objective to reduce the number of work-related accidents by 2020.  102  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S. A .   This is a one-way journey. Overcoming challenges, innovating, exploring new ways of achieving more with less, inï¬‚uencing our value chain by setting an example, promoting the well-being of communities, create value in harmony with nature, make our work fascinating and rewarding. This is the work of a vast team â€“ almost 4,500 employees all over the world â€“ who invest their skills and enthusiasm in this mission. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone. Also, a word of thanks is due to all our stakeholders for their collaboration and trust during 2018.  Cordially, Cristina Rios de Amorim Board Member and Director of Sustainability  SUSTAINABILIT Y REP O RT â€”  103   104  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S. A .   1  ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Corticeira Amorim has regularly published a sustainability report since 2006 â€“ an unprecedented practice in the cork sector â€“ promoting transparency, improving practices and fostering the adoption of the principles of sustainability both in its value chain and among its principal stakeholders. In 2017, we once again began to produce an annual sustainability report, included in the Consolidated Annual Report, thereby increasing the dissemination of this information to a wider number of stakeholders.  Key indicators from previous years are included, where possible, appropriate and relevant, to provide stakeholders with a perspective of the companyâ€™s development.  This current report, generically entitled the 2018 Sustainability Report, details the economic, social and environmental performance of the Corticeira Amorim in 2018 (perimeter indicated below). It has been drawn up in accordance with the latest GRI guidelines â€“ GRI Standards 2016 for the core level and meets the legal requirements introduced by Portugalâ€™s Decree-Law no. 89/2017 of July 28, being, under article 508-G of the Commercial Companies Code, a Consolidated Non-Financial Statement of Corticeira Amorim, SGPS, S.A..  In 2018, Corticeira Amorim implemented a stakeholder consultation process, which made it possible to identify the sustainability issues that stakeholders consider to be relevant in the framework of the Organisationâ€™s activities.  The content of this report is complemented by publically accessible information contained in the Groupâ€™s Consolidated Management Report, the Corporate Governance Report and on the company website â€“ www.amorim.com.  Combining the importance that various sustainability themes have for stakeholders and for Corticeira Amorim, a matrix was built illustrating the materiality of the various themes of the social, environmental and economic pillars, which served as the basis for the selection of information to be considered in this report.  Materiality Matrix â€“ Corticeira Amorim High  Level of importance of the topic for Corticeira AmorimÂ´s stakeholders  Promotion of the "Montado", its Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services  Ethics and Anti-Corruption Materials Management  Product Environmental Impact  Sustainable Supplier Management Client Privacy  Economic Performance  Research, Development and Innovation  Energy Eï¬ƒciency and Climate Change  Compliance Waste and Eï¬„uents Management  Health and Safety at Work Circular Economy  Water Management and Use  Product Quality and Responsibility  Training and Development  Employment and Labour Relations Diversity and Equal Opportunities Human Rights  Impact on Local Community  Low  High  Level of importance of the topic for Corticeira Amorim SUSTAINABILIT Y REP ORT â€”  105   The process showed that the most signiï¬cant topics for Corticeira Amorim and its stakeholders are: Promotion of the Montado, its Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services; Economic Performance; Research, Development and Innovation; Energy Eï¬ƒciency and Climate Change; Health and Safety at Work; Circular Economy; Product Environmental Impact (including the topic of Product Quality and Responsibility). In view of its importance for the Organisation, the topic of Training and Development was also considered to be relevant for the purposes of this report. The criterion adopted to deï¬ne the universe of companies covered by this report was to include all units that generate signiï¬cant impacts in regard to the areas referred to above. The scope of the report therefore does not include all the companies in the Corticeira Amorim group, largely due to the diï¬ƒculty of implementing sustainability information systems in smaller companies. A plan for its gradual inclusion is underway. The companies covered include 86% of the Corticeira Amorim groupâ€™s industrial units and corresponded to 74% of its employees at the end of 2018. The methodologies used to calculate indicators, used in addition to the GRI Standards Guidelines 2016, are explained in chapter 7. Methodological Notes. Whenever the reported data does not refer to all the companies covered, the area covered considered is indicated. Similarly, whenever the reported data are derived from estimates, the basis on which these estimates are calculated is presented. Validation of the sustainability information included in this report was conducted by Ernst & Young Audit & Associados, SROC, S.A..

The shares that represent its share capital currently amount to â‚¬133 million and are listed on Euronext Lisbon. 2.1.2. Operational Structure Corticeira Amorimâ€™s operations are organised into ï¬ve Business Units (BUs). Corticeira Amorim adopts a management model based on a strategicoperational holding concept, where the BU are coordinated by Corticeira Amorimâ€™s Executive Board. Each BU has its own Board of Directors, composed of non-executive members and executive members, which has the power to decide on all matters that are considered to be relevant. Each BU also has an Executive Board, which is composed of highly qualiï¬ed, independent executives, who have suitable technical and professional skills to manage the respective business activities and the speciï¬c challenges associated to current and potential future activities. In the BU, executive management is the exclusive responsibility of independent professional managers. In other words, it is the CEO of the BU, rather than the Chairman of the Board of Directors who is responsible for executive management. In the case of the Cork Stoppers BU, given the complexity of the business, there are two independent professional Joint CEOs.  Composite Cork BU: focuses on the production of granulated cork, agglomerates and cork composites. The natural properties of cork, enhanced by combination with other materials, result in the development of cutting-edge solutions for a wide range of business sectors including construction, footwear, aerospace, railways, electricity transformers and interior design, among others; Insulation Cork BU: is dedicated to the production of insulation materials with excellent technical performance standards that are rigorously 100% natural. The unique characteristics of expanded cork agglomerate ensure a high level of thermal, acoustic and anti-vibration insulation â€“ as well as practically unlimited durability â€“ making it a material of choice for sustainable construction projects. Because of its tactile appeal, it is also being increasingly used in interior design .  The use of the balanced scorecard method by Corticeira Amorim and its BUs enhances the strategic alignment of the whole organisation. It is the responsibility of Corticeira Amorimâ€™s Board of Directors to approve the objectives and strategic initiatives that (i) apply to the whole organisation, (ii) that are speciï¬c to Corticeira Amorim and (iii) of each BU in strict collaboration with the respective Executive Boards. 2.1.3. Main Products and Services Corticeira Amorim is continually deepening its knowledge of cork as a raw material, through research, development and innovation of a vast portfolio of sustainable products and applications that anticipate market trends and exceed the expectations of some of the worldâ€™s most demanding industries â€“ such as wines and spirits, aerospace, construction, and interior design. Highlights include: Cork Stoppers BU: world leader in the production and supply of cork stoppers with an annual production of 5,5 billion units. Its extensive portfolio of natural cork stoppers (for wine, sparkling wine and spirits) and its own distribution network place it in an unparalleled position to supply the ideal cork stopper for every wine segment and in any part of the world; Floor and Wall Coverings BU: world leader in the production and distribution of cork ï¬‚ooring and wall coverings. In line with sustainability and nature-inspired values, the Floor and Wall Coverings BU produces high quality and sustainable ï¬‚ooring, thereby ensuring better quality of life, while preserving the environment. The use of a multi-layer structure, which combines the natural and exclusive properties of cork with state-of-the-art technology, has made it possible to develop superior ï¬‚oors, which oï¬€er unique beneï¬ts, such as greater acoustic and thermal insulation, greater walking comfort and superior indoor air quality;  SUSTAINA BILIT Y REP O RT â€”  107   2.1.4.

PEOPLE AND CULT URE  This shared culture is based on:  Aware of its responsibility as a critical player in its area of activity, Corticeira Amorim fully assumes its leadership role, fostering the ambition to continuously develop new cork solutions that combine exceptional technical performance, a premium factor and unique sustainability credentials and that add value to the market when compared with more conventional solutions.  Mission: To add value to cork in a competitive, diï¬€erentiating and innovative manner, in perfect harmony with Nature.  It is a source of pride to work with a natural raw material as versatile as the thousands of applications that cork gives rise to and, Corticeira Amorim believes, that it will continue to generate. However, it is, in fact, the companyâ€™s employees all around the world who support Corticeira Amorimâ€™s growth and innovation strategy. This is why the company advocates a people management policy that promotes ambition and challenge, commitment and demand, cooperation and working in partnership. Developing a work environment where transparent communication, internal equity and diversity of every kind are imperatives is the fundamental goal underpinning the companyâ€™s policies and practices as they relate to people and work environments. Corticeira Amorim belives that to go far, a group of women and men from diï¬€erent countries with diï¬€erent roles should all converge in a shared culture, in which identiï¬cation with its products and its business is something that everyone can share.  108  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP ORT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MORIM , S.G.P.S., S. A .  Values: Pride â€“ We take pride in the tradition of our business, in our Company history and in the knowledge that we have accumulated in the many years of work of diï¬€erent generations. We are proud to work with a raw material that comes from the earth that is sustainable, has an identity, and combines tradition, modernity and innovation.

Reï¬‚ecting the professionalism and the ethics of its leaders and managers â€“ as well as their culture â€“ some aspects related to these issues are not formally set down in writing or publicly available.  2.3.2. Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct Corticeira Amorim has formalised a Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to guide the professional behaviour of all its employees. The Code is the subject of regular reï¬‚exion and revision, most recently in 2017. The Code currently covers 12 areas: Ã— Professional use of the companyâ€™s assets;  While being convinced that the risks to which the Companyâ€™s activity is subject are fully covered and the interests of its stakeholders safeguarded, the Company is aware of the increasing emphasis and scrutiny given to such matters and has begun a detailed analysis of its current practices. This analysis is underway and aims, wherever possible and appropriate, to give formal expression to these matters and to disseminate them.  Ã— Privacy and conï¬dentiality;  The policies adopted by Corticeira Amorim reï¬‚ect a set of commitments by the Company in the areas of ethics and economic, environmental and social responsibility. Together, they embody the responsibilities assumed by the diï¬€erent companies within the framework of a management model that advocates responsible competitiveness. Full details can be found at https://www.amorim.com/en/sustainability/ integrated-management-system/policies-and-management-system/ and: https://www.amorim.com/en/for-investors/institutionalinformations/board-members/.  Ã— Corruption/bribery;  2.3.1. Human Rights Defending and respecting human rights is a fundamental practice for Corticeira Amorim. No cases of discrimination have been identiï¬ed in any of the groupâ€™s activities or operations, nor has any risk of child labour, forced or compulsory labour or restrictions on the freedom of association or freedom of unionisation been identiï¬ed.  Ã— Data protection;  The work with Corticeira Amorimâ€™s chain of suppliers is carried out in accordance with institutional and legal structures. Working conditions in the supply chain satisfy the labour legislation in force in each region where Corticeira Amorim operates. Although no such risks have been identiï¬ed in the companyâ€™s activities or in the supply chain, Corticeira Amorimâ€™s aim is to continue adopting practices which distinguish it positively in terms of sustainable development and the safeguarding of human rights, promoting â€“ by example and awareness-raising initiatives â€“ these practices throughout the supply chain. Thus, Corticeira Amorimâ€™s methodology for the qualiï¬cation and assessment of suppliers includes, among other means, the use of social responsibility indexes, as detailed in subchapter 2.4. Supply Chain, and at https:// www.amorim.com/en/sustainability/integrated-management-system/ policies-and-management-system.  Ã— Rules governing the use of information technology; Ã— Relations between employees; Ã— Community;  Ã— Customers and suppliers; Ã— Communication with the exterior; Ã— Corporate image; Ã— Industrial property;  Ã— Human rights/preventing harassment. 2.3.3. Corruption and Bribery The identiï¬cation and assessment of the risks of corruption and bribery in the markets where Corticeira Amorim operates is carried out jointly by the Executive Board and the BUâ€™ management teams, taking into account the speciï¬c characteristics of each market and is complemented by internal control process audits that assess the conformity of processes and identify ineï¬ƒciencies. Corticeira Amorim has deï¬ned a procedure for communicating irregularities and it is incumbent on the companyâ€™s Statutory Audit Committee, a body composed entirely of independent members, to receive, in accordance with its operating regulations, any notice of irregularities (addressed to the Statutory Audit Committee and sent by post to the companyâ€™s registered oï¬ƒce) communicated by shareholders, employees or other persons or entities, and to deal with them appropriately. After analysing the irregularities communicated, it is also the committeeâ€™s responsibility to suggest measures for preventing the occurrence of such irregularities. No irregularities were communicated in the 2018 ï¬nancial year. More information on this can be found in the Corporate Governance Report, chapter C. Internal Organisation, II. Communicating irregularities.  SUSTAINABILIT Y REP O RT â€”  109   2.3.4.

Voluntary Commitments Charter of Principles of the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD Portugal)Â  BCSD Portugal is part of the world network of WBCSD â€“ World Business Council for Sustainable Development. In Portugal it is the umbrella organisation of more than 90 leading companies that are actively committed to ensuring a smooth transition to sustainability. Corticeira Amorim subscribed in November 2017 to the Charter of Principles which sets out the fundamental principles of sustainability that subscribing companies voluntarily adopt, seeking to absorb them into their value chain and sphere of inï¬‚uence. The Charter also encourages subscribers to go beyond compliance with legal norms by adopting recognized norms and practices, aligned with ethical, social, environmental and quality standards, in any context of the global economy. Like all subscribers to the Charter, Corticeira Amorim: Ã— recognises the importance of sharing information about sustainability with its stakeholders, giving answers and clarifying any doubts or concerns in the area of sustainability, thus contributing towards stressing the importance and relevance of adopting sustainable practices; Ã— considers the Charter to be an initiative that is applicable throughout the value chain and will seek to open a dialogue with its direct and relevant suppliers in order to encourage them to sign up to the Charter; Ã— commits itself to the ambitions set out in the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals. The Charter can be consulted at: https://www.bcsdportugal.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ Carta_Principios_BCSDPortugal_ENG.pdf Charter of Principles of the Porto Protocol The Porto Protocol is a new movement, founded in Porto by Adrian Bridge, president of The Fladgate Partnership group, which began with over 96 companies to share and discuss solutions to tackle climate change and minimise its impacts. For the global launch of the initiative, the Climate Change Leadership Porto Summit 2018 was held in Porto, attended by countless personalities, including Barack Obama, former president of the USA, Mohan Munasinghe, 2007 nobel peace prize winner and Irina Bokova, general director of UNESCO. The summit focused on the issue of climate change and solutions to mitigate this problem. The Porto Protocol and its Charter of Principles were also presented during the summit. This movement aims to create synergies between companies committed to ï¬ghting climate change in the awareness that, by their example, they can inï¬‚uence other entities to support this cause. The members of the Porto Protocol undertake to pursue their activity on the basis of good environmental principles, and execute projects that improve the sustainability of their respective organisations. The Porto Protocol also foresees the development of partnerships among members, the possibility of disseminating ideas and providing access to new learning tools, reports and expertise produced by oï¬ƒcial entities.

Corticeira Amorim considers that raw material suppliers (mainly of cork) and transportation services assume dominant importance in its value chain, given their critical importance to the business and their relative weight in the companyâ€™s cost structure. Corticeira Amorim has a vertically integrated business model, encompassing all stages of production, from purchase of the raw material to commercialisation of a varied portfolio of cork products, sold to over 25,000 customers, wherein 93% of products are exported â€“ to over 100 countries.

Procurement and Supply of Cork The integrated management of the business begins with the Raw Materials BU. Its mission is to guarantee the supply of all types of cork raw materials for the diï¬€erent BUs and their respective market applications, wherein it is responsible for preparing, discussing and deciding on Corticeira Amorimâ€™s multi-annual supply strategy. The Raw Materials BU assumes other important missions, and has a signiï¬cant impact on the accumulation of knowledge about cork oak forests (montado) and improvements in the quality of the cork produced. Among other activities, the BU promotes the forest certiï¬cation of cork producers, including Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certiï¬cation. The BU is characterised by its strong research and forestry development policies. Introducing new cork production techniques by means of improved irrigation processes is one of its priority areas with the aim of increasing the quality and quantity of the cork produced to ensure the sustainability of the business. Further information is available in the subchapter 5.1.2. Forestry Intervention Project. Over recent years, this BU has adopted a policy of diversiï¬cation of its supply sources, in order to take proactive action in all regions of cork production (Mediterranean Basin, as shown below), being concentrated in Portugal (72%). These are also the areas where Corticeira Amorimâ€™s operations are mainly located. Of the total number of employees identiï¬ed in this report, 95% (more than 3 100 jobs) belong to units located in this geographic area, demonstrating the importance of the Companyâ€™s activity for the social and economic promotion of these areas, while preserving cork forests â€“ one of the largest natural treasures of the Mediterranean Basin.

Portugal has the largest area of cork forest in the world, which corresponds to about one third of the worldâ€™s total cork forests. About 126 000 hectares of this area have FSC certiï¬cation (FSC Portugal, 12/31/2017). In 2004, Corticeira Amorim became the ï¬rst company in the cork industry to receive the FSC chain of custody certiï¬cation. In anticipation of the needs of the wine industry â€“ the customer for its main product â€“ it also became the ï¬rst packaging company in the world to receive this certiï¬cation. Among other initiatives, Corticeira Amorim was responsible, between 2008 and 2015, for a free technical advice service for forest producers who are jointly responsible for more than 20 000 hectares of cork oak forest in Portugal. The advice was aimed at identifying and adopting best management practices and supporting biodiversity. The service was launched in October 2007, when Corticeira Amorim joined the European Commissionâ€™s Business and Biodiversity Initiative, through a protocol established in partnership with Portugalâ€™s Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests (ICNF) and two NGOs â€“ World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Quercus â€“ AssociaÃ§Ã£o Nacional de ConservaÃ§Ã£o da Natureza (Quercus). As well as the technical advisory service for forest producers, the agreement was also aimed at encouraging forestry research and disseminating best management practices. Corticeira Amorim continues to focus on product development in accordance with FSC principles and aims to maintain FSC certiï¬cation, a well-known international standard. By the end of 2018, around 29 Corticeira Amorim (industrial and/or distribution) units had received chain of custody certiï¬cation in accordance with FSC regulations, providing the market with increased guarantees in terms of protection of biodiversity, workersâ€™ rights, rights of indigenous peoples and areas of signiï¬cant environmental and cultural importance. 2.4.2. Procurement and Supply of Non- Cork Products To manage the purchase of all non-cork materials, services and contracts, including transportation, the company runs a Central Purchasing Department. Its mission is to manage the portfolio of suppliers professionally and from a global perspective to maximise the sustainable creation of value by Corticeira Amorim, seeking excellence in the goods and services acquired and in permanent harmony with the goals of Corticeira Amorim companies. In this context, Corticeira Amorim privileges the establishment of stable and lasting partnerships with suppliers and enjoys a high degree of loyalty among its main suppliers. During 2018, this Department supervised a global volume of purchases of more than â‚¬140 million, carried out in several countries, predominantly in Portugal Pre-qualification, Qualification and Evaluation of Suppliers The company has deï¬ned a methodology for the pre-qualiï¬cation, qualiï¬cation and evaluation of suppliers, partly based on social responsibility (IRSoc) and environmental responsability indexes (IRAmb): suppliers are qualiï¬ed to supply Corticeira Amorim in function of the quality of the good or services they supply, their delivery times and their social responsibility and environmental responsibility indices. Methodology for Evaluating the Social Responsibility Index (IRSoc) The IRSoc is calculated according to the percentage of requirements met by the supplier. If the supplier is certiï¬ed in accordance with the NP 4469 standard, they will be given an IRSoc of 100%. For each requirement that the supplier does not undertake to comply with, 25% will be subtracted from their IRSoc.  112  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S.

For each requirement that the supplier does not undertake to comply with, 25% will be subtracted from their IRAmb. If a supplier is found not to meet one or more of the requirements to which they have committed, they will be given an IRSoc or IRAmb of zero. Further information on the requirements of these indices can be found at https://www.amorim.com/en/sustainability/integratedmanagement-system/policies-and-management-system/. A supplier audit programme is drawn up each year, based on a speciï¬c set of criteria, including the following: supplier performance in the previous year, criticality of the products / services provided or whether it is a new supplier, and including quality, environmental and social aspects. After each audit, the supplierâ€™s performance is evaluated. When nonconformities are identiï¬ed, a plan of action is requested and, in function of the criticality of the detected nonconformities, the companies of the Corticeira Amorim group can conduct follow-up audits to check implementation of the speciï¬ed actions. There may also be a need to collaborate with the supplier to resolve nonconformities or ï¬nd alternatives to that supplier. During 2018, Corticeira Amorim did not substitute suppliers as a result of the pre-qualiï¬cation, qualiï¬cation and evaluation process of suppliers. 2.4.3.

Ã— diï¬€erentiating its approach according to the category and nature of the process in question; Ã— aligning the technological platform with management processing and information requirements. In recent years, the transport area has become a critical factor for the business in both economic and environmental terms. This is due, on one hand, to an increase in costs caused by fuel price rises, and, on the other, by the weight transport has in the consumption and emissions of upstream and downstream operations in the value chain. Upstream and Downstream Activities in the Value Chain Emissions generated in the value chain occur mainly during the transport of raw materials and products, which are primarily handled by external logistics service providers. Upstream and downstream transport and distribution accounts for 96% of scope 3 emissions ascertained. The values presented below consider the most important aspects of Corticeira Amorimâ€™s value chain, for its activity in Portugal. In 2018, there was an increase in scope 3 emissions compared to 2017, as a result of an increase in business activity. Information on scope 1 and 2 emissions can be found in subchapter 5.2.

SU STAINABILI T Y MANAGE MENT STRUCT URE Corticeira Amorim reï¬‚ects continually on its corporate governance in the light of Portuguese and international best practices, the developing circumstances of its business activities and the challenges to which it has to respond. As a result, it has implemented a set of measures that seek to strengthen internal control and oversight systems, increase transparency, encourage the participation of all stakeholders in the life of the company and ensure the sustained creation of value for stakeholders. Best corporate governance practices are a cornerstone of Corticeira Amorimâ€™s sustainable development. The Corporate Governance Report sets out in detail the structure and practices of corporate governance, describing on the website https://www.amorim.com/en/sustainability/ management-of-corporate-sustainability/ the material considered relevant or complementary to this report, in particular: Ã— consultation and involvement of stakeholders; Ã— the organisational structure supporting corporate sustainability (CS) management. The integrated sustainability management system is based on Corticeira Amorimâ€™s mission and values. It advocates: Interaction with stakeholders, especially consulting them regularly. This is considered fundamental for validating strategic options and for gauging expectations regarding the matters that stakeholders want Corticeira Amorim to monitor and communicate to them. Additional information about stakeholder consultation in 2018 can be found in subchapter 3.2. Engagement with Stakeholders. Strategy: The strategic alignment of the whole organisation is strengthened by the use of the balanced scorecard method. It falls to the Board of Directors to approve strategic goals, strategic initiatives and priority actions. The integration of processes with the strategic perspectives of the balanced scorecard strengthens sustainable development practices  114  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S.

Main Means of Communication Corticeira Amorim seeks to manage engagement and communication with its stakeholders in the best way possible for understanding and responding to their concerns and expectations. To this end, the company uses a diï¬€erentiated range of communication methods and channels, as summarised in the following table. The communications methods used are subject to regular review.   3.2.3. Consultation Corticeira Amorim has deï¬ned a regular stakeholder consultation and engagement process that enables the company to identify the core sustainability issues to considered among future priorities and for designing a strategy for their respective engagement. The most recent process occurred in 2018. a) Procedures used and structure of the questionnaire Procedures used: Duration: the questionnaire was conducted from July to August 2018 by Pricewaterhousecoopers (PwC). Distribution: the stakeholders of the various BUs were sent an email by the various contact persons at Corticeira Amorim inviting them to complete the questionnaire provided on an online platform. Whenever asked to do so by Corticeira Amorim, PwC sent stakeholders an email to emphasise the request to complete the questionnaire. Types of questions: the questionnaire consisted of three groups of open and closed questions with the possibility of adding additional comments. The questionnaire was divided into three main sections: Sustainability vision: a question about whether Corticeira Amorim was considered to be an organisation with a clear vision of its economic, environmental and social responsibilities, with a ï¬eld to add explanatory examples. Sustainability performance: two questions: the ï¬rst, multiple choice, identiï¬ed Corticeira Amorimâ€™s importance and performance in sustainability themes, with a ï¬eld to add other relevant non-predeï¬ned themes; the second, open-ended, was designed to identify opportunities for improvement in themes selected in the preceding questions that performed poorly. Sustainability report: ï¬ve questions: the ï¬rst question aimed to identify whether the stakeholders had read the latest sustainability report; the second aimed to classify the information provided in the report overall; the third aimed to classify the sustainability report according to seven criteria; the fourth, open-ended, aimed to present suggestions for improvement for the sustainability report assessment criteria; and the ï¬fth, also open-ended, aimed to include new themes in the sustainability report that had not been referred to in previous iterations. b) Sample characterisation and response rate Throughout the 2009-2018 period, various stakeholder consultation processes were held, with a gradual increase in the size of the sample. In the 2018 process, which involved many respondents (74%), 137 stakeholders and relevant sustainability themes were identiï¬ed under GRI guidelines and in line with AccountAbilityâ€™s AA1000Â Stakeholder Engagement Standard (AA1000SES) criteria and the requirements of ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. c) Distribution of responses by stakeholder group  Employees 29%  Clients 24%  Oï¬ƒcial and Government Entities 4% Partners & Civil Society 7% Suppliers 19%  Shareholders and Investors 8%  Media 6%  NGOs & Community 3%  SUSTAINA BILIT Y REP O RT â€”  117   d) Main conclusions of the consultation process Sustainability vision Most (89%) of Corticeira Amorimâ€™s stakeholders felt the organisation had a clear vision of its economic, social and environmental responsibilities.

On the themes of â€œHuman Rightsâ€, â€œWater Management and Useâ€ and â€œMaterials Managementâ€, stakeholders awarded a signiï¬cantly higher level of importance compared to 2015. The most important theme identiï¬ed by stakeholders was â€œPromotion of the montado, its Biodiversity and Ecosystem Servicesâ€. â€œEthics and Anti-Corruptionâ€ is the third most important theme for stakeholders and the one that reveals the best perceived performance by respondents. â€œEconomic Performanceâ€ is identiï¬ed as the second most important theme and second best performing theme at Corticeira Amorim.  118  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S.

Sustainability Performance Question posed to stakeholders: â€œConsidering the Corticeira Amorimâ€™s business activity, classify the level of performance the various themes?â€ â€œHuman Rightsâ€ and â€œEmployment and Labour Relationsâ€ show the most signiï¬cant improvements in performance as perceived by stakeholders compared with 2015. Declines were seen in perceived performance assessment with regard to the themes of â€œPromotion of the montado, its Biodiversity and Ecosystem Servicesâ€ and â€œImpact on the Local Communityâ€. To a general degree, for the stakeholders consulted, Corticeira Amorim has performed well in the ï¬ve themes considered most important. There is an opportunity to improve the themes of â€œHuman Rightsâ€ and â€œEmployment and Labour Relationsâ€ that revealed lower perceived performance compared to the results as a whole.

SU STAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PRIORI TIE S  Strategy aligned with 12 of the 17 SDGs The strategic priorities for sustainable development identiï¬ed by Corticeira Amorim comprise economic, environmental and social concerns that take into consideration the results of consulting stakeholders, benchmarking analysis, internal commitments and policies and alignment with the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ambitions established by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Approved by 193 countries in September 2015, the 17 SDGs make up part of the 2030 sustainable development agenda of the United Nations. They are the result of governments and citizens all around the world working together to establish a new global model capable of ending poverty, providing prosperity and well-being for all, protecting the environment and combatting climate change. In 2018, Corticeira Amorim revised its sustainable development strategy based on materiality analysis, in order to foster alignment with stakeholdersâ€™ expectations and feedback. It also identiï¬ed the SDGs that are most related to the material themes, and selected performance indicators and key targets for each relevant SDG.

It also recognizes the importance of Research, Development and Innovation to ï¬nd long-lasting solutions to major social, economic and environmental challenges. Cork is, by nature, such a formidable material that it might seem impossible to improve it. But that is precisely what Corticeira Amorim has done since its foundation â€“ with a ï¬rm commitment to ensuring diï¬€erentiation through quality and making a unique contribution, unparalleled in the industry, to the reinvention of an exceptional natural resource that responds to the main challenges of todayâ€™s society, beneï¬tting people, the planet and sustainable development. Research, development and innovation (R&D+I) is strategic to business development and value creation for all of Corticeira Amorimâ€™s BUs. The company also has a decisive and autonomous transversal structure â€“ Amorim Cork Research. Each BU also has its own R&D+I competences. More information is detailed in the Innovation, Research & Product Development chapter of the Consolidated Management Report for the ï¬nancial year 2018. The companyâ€™s R&D+I policy is guided by the following principles: Ã— Developing new products and markets for cork; Ã— Seeking out new technological solutions, in terms of both products and processes, in partnerships with customers, suppliers and other bodies; Ã— Strengthening the reputation of its brands through the constant evolution of product ranges in response to new market and consumer trends;  SDG 8.2Â Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversiï¬cation, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labourintensive sectors.

Cork is a 100% natural raw material and Corticeira Amorim has developed a varied portfolio of cork-based products, that are used by some of the worldâ€™s most technologically advanced and demanding industries, such as the wine and spirits industries, aerospace, construction, sports, interior design and fashion. The cork oak forest is of crucial importance to the economy and ecology of several Mediterranean countries. Portugal has 34% of the worldâ€™s total cork forests, corresponding to an area of 736 thousand hectares and 23% of Portugalâ€™s forestry area. The cork oak is found mainly in Southern Portugal, with the Alentejo occupying a prominent place â€“ with 84% of the total. Annual worldwide cork production is 201 thousands tons, and Portugal once again stands out as the worldâ€™s biggest cork producer, with 49.6% of the world total. Portuguese cork exports account for about 2% of Portuguese exports, 1.2% of total exports and a trade balance of â‚¬815.6 million, equivalent to a coverage rate of 578%.

The pan-European conservation network Natura 2000 rates the montado as highly important for conserving biodiversity. This ecosystem is highly biodiverse, including threatened species such as the emblematic Iberian lynx and Iberian imperial eagle, and provides society with countless services, ranging from regulation of the climate and water cycles to protection against erosion and wildï¬res, carbon sequestration, cultural services such as open-air leisure activities, cork and ï¬rewood production, and cattle rearing. The production of cork on the estate (key to its economic viability) does not aï¬€ect the countless services provided by the ecosystem since the cork-extraction process â€“ stripping â€“ does not harm the tree. The cork oak lives for 200 years on average, during which it may be harvested between 15 to 18 times. The cork oak is the only oak species whose bark regenerates after extraction. The WWFâ€™s Living Planet Report 2018 underlines the importance of nature to people and mentions that â€œall economic activity ultimately depends on services provided by nature, making it an immensely valuable component of a nationâ€™s wealth.â€ The same report notes that the ecosystem services supplied by nature globally are worth around $125 trillion per year. Corticeira Amorim is conscious of its role in ensuring the viability of cork oak forests and considers that their defence/ preservation is a strategic priority. The companyâ€™s contribution to the maintenance, conservation and enhancement of the cork oak forest is based on the following guidelines:  124  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S.

In 2018, a number of life cycle analysis and Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) studies were carried out in the various BUs, through which it has been possible to highlight the superior environmental performance of cork solutions, based on internationally recognised standards.  CASE STUDY Study on Neutrocorkâ€™s carbon footprint in the Cork Stoppers BU Objective: The Neutrocork stopper is recommended for wines with a certain complexity and is used by thousands of wine producers around the world. The recent study, conducted by PwC, aimed to conï¬rm that this stopper has a negative carbon footprint, thus reiterating the groupâ€™s commitment to protecting the environment. Initiatives: In this independent PwC study, a life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology was used, following the guidelines of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute. The Cradle to Gate methodology made it possible to calculate the carbon emissions of the Neutrocork stopper across the entire production process and distribution process to the UK. Results: The study concluded that the Neutrocork stopper has a negative carbon footprint of -342 kg of CO2 per ton of product, corresponding to -1.8 g of CO2 per cork stopper. When considering the carbon retention capacity of the cork oak forest associated with cork production, the result is even more impressive: a total of -73 342 kg CO2 per ton of product, or -392 g CO2 per cork stopper. This independent study conï¬rmed the environmental credentials of the Neutrocork stopper, a solution that, in addition to its technical excellence, highlights the value of cork as one of the worldâ€™s most exceptional natural and sustainable materials.  SUSTAINA BILIT Y REP O RT â€”  125   CASE STUDY Rigorous Quality Control in Amorim Isolamentos Objective: The Insulation Cork BU is dedicated to the production of acoustic and thermal insulation agglomerated cork, 100% natural and with a high technical performance. The goal is to recognize the superior quality and sustainability of its products in comparison with conventional products. With virtually unlimited durability, cork retains all its characteristics throughout the productâ€™s lifetime, in addition to being 100% natural and fully recyclable. It is industrially produced without recourse to additives and requires reduced energy consumption. Initiatives: Subjection of processes and products to rigorous certiï¬cation processes.

Forestry Intervention Project Corticeira Amorim has been working on a project aimed at ensuring the preservation and sustainable development of cork oak forests â€“ the Forestry Intervention Project. Under the motto â€œtake care of the present, build the futureâ€, the main guidelines include improving the installation of irrigation systems, sequencing the cork oak genome, improving the cork oak species and combatting pests and diseases. The project was born out of an experimental plantation of cork oaks that Francisco de Almeida Garrett, owner of the Herdade do Conqueiro estate in Avis, Alentejo (Portugal), began irrigating a few years ago. The success of his experiment â€“ the ï¬rst cork harvest for some trees was made after only eight years instead of the normal 20-25 years â€“ motivated him to contact Corticeira Amorim. The company, aware of the importance of these results, immediately involved the University of Ã‰vora. In this context, the ï¬rst structured plantation of 50 hectares of cork oak trees was launched in 2017, which is innovative compared to other areas of cork forest, since it beneï¬ts from an improved irrigation system. This system provides drip irrigation for new trees until the ï¬rst extraction of cork, at which point the cork tree returns to its normal growth pattern, with cork harvested at nine-year intervals. In the plan deï¬ned for the Forestry Intervention Project, the goal is, with involvement and support of forest owners, to plant 50 thousand hectares of cork oak trees, with a higher density than current areas of cork forest, and thereby increase cork production by 30%.  CASE STUDY Improving the cork oak and crossbreeding diï¬€erent species in the Raw Materials BU Objective: Select trees only by crossbreeding species naturally without any genetic manipulation. The goal is to produce trees that are better adapted to soil and climate conditions as well as to climate change to produce quality cork. Initiatives: Ã— Mycorrhiza process â€“ application of a fungus to the roots of cork oaks to increase their robustness and resistance; Ã— Sequencing the cork oak genome â€“ mapping the cork oakâ€™s genetic code will make it possible to identify the genetic markers for cork quality and to develop other markers for identifying pestâ€“ and disease-resistant trees, enabling an ideal selection of cork oaks while retaining genetic variability; Ã— Research focused on pest and disease control. Results: A combination of traps and volatile attractants (pheromones) will be in the ï¬nal phase of experimentation, which will allow the bio-rational control of Coraebus Undatus â€“ the ï¬‚athead oak borer â€“ reducing the number of aï¬€ected trees.  SUSTAINA BILIT Y REP O RT â€”  127   CASE STUDY Project LIFE+ SUBER in the Raw Materials BU Objective: To contribute to the better adaptation and resistance of cork oak forests to climate change, ensuring their conservation and the maintenance of the associated value chain. The programme also includes the objectives of combatting water stress, the growth of pests and the frequency of wildï¬res. Launched in 2014, the project was led by the Consorci ForestalÂ deÂ Catalunya in association, besides Amorim Florestal, with the Centre Tecnologic Forestal da Catalunya, Forestal Catalana and the Centro de la Propiedad Florestal de Catalunya. It was supported by the European Commission under the LIFE programme and was co-ï¬nanced by Amorim Florestal MediterrÃ¢neo, the DiputaciÃ³ de Barcelona and the Institut CatalÃ  del Suro. Initiatives: The project was developed in Catalonia and covered a total of 108 hectares of forest and associated control areas. A total of 28 measures were implemented grouped into diï¬€erent categories:  Ã— Dissemination measures: to convey the techniques and tools developed under the project to owners and managers of montado. Results: Through the Life+ SUBER project, innovative forestry management models were applied to improve the vitality and production of the cork oak forest, reducing the risk of wildï¬res. With measures such as selective pruning and on-site treatment of the waste residues from cork harvesting, there is a reduction in the density of small trees and maintenance of the large trees. It is thereby hoped that cork production will increase. These interventions also lessened forest vulnerability, attaining important improvements with regard to treetop ï¬res leading to high-density wildï¬res, in particular. Pest control measures were also applied, namely biorational control of Coraebus Undatus, contributing signiï¬cantly to knowledge of this insect. Finally, cork oak restoration measures were applied by setting up protective systems for endangered trees, creating the conditions in which they can naturally regenerate and increase forest vitality.  Ã— Implementation measures: establishment of demonstrative pilot plantations with diï¬€erent innovative forest management techniques, from irregular management with selective cleaning to planting of cork oaks, restoration of degraded areas and massive removal of Coraebus Undatus; Ã— Continuation measures: to test the eï¬€ectiveness of measures used and propose changes to improve techniques; 5.1.3. Acquisition of the Herdade da Baliza estate In 2018, Corticeira Amorim acquired the Herdade da Baliza estate, a property in the Castelo Branco/Tagus International region covering a total of 2 866 hectares for â‚¬5,5 million. This acquisition marked the companyâ€™s ï¬rst step as a forest owner, a strategic operation aimed at implementing new cork oak forest management techniques and leading by example. 5.1.4. Location of Operations Corticeira Amorimâ€™s activities are conducted in areas outside those classiï¬ed by the Instituto da ConservaÃ§Ã£o da Natureza e das Florestas (ICNF) as protected. There is therefore no signiï¬cant impact on biodiversity.  128  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S. A .   5.2. E NERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE  Positive carbon balance 65% of energy used from biomass 72 thousand tons of CO2 emissions avoided Global megatrends, such as climate change and resource scarcity, population growth, heightened urbanisation, changes in global economic power and technological advances are aï¬€ecting consumer and company decision-making all around the world. At Corticeira Amorim, we respond proactively to these trends, promoting the montado, adopting a business model based on the circular economy and developing high-added-value green products based on renewable and recyclable materials that facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Corticeira Amorimâ€™s contribution to the ï¬ght against climate change therefore involves continual improvement of its energy performance and the implementation of production technologies and processes that ensure the optimisation of the amount of cork used throughout the industrial process. As one of the main promoters of the montado, it also contributes in this way to ï¬ghting climate change as cork oak trees are major carbon sinks, since they use their roots, leaves, trunk and bark (cork) to store carbon during their lives, which may last over 200 years. Investing in cork recycling programmes globally is another important contribution, given that extending the life cycle of cork through recycling delays the release of emissions of carbon embedded in cork back into the atmosphere. In 2013, Corticeira Amorim established an environmental policy common to all its BUs and subsidiaries. In alignment with its principles and sustainable management practices, it made commitments to: Ã— Guarantee compliance with all legal stipulations and other requirements agreed to by the organisation and applicable to all the environmental aspects of its activities, products and services; Ã— Control signiï¬cant environmental impacts and contribute to preventing pollution:  To implement these commitments, the various Corticeira Amorim BUs have set up diï¬€erent management systems and gained certiï¬cation under the various standards described in subchapter 2.3. Principles and Policies, namely ISO 14001 and ISO 50001, which, with regard to the whole reported perimeter, cover 23% of the industrial units (IUs), correspond to 56% of energy used and, amongst other things, foresee speciï¬c procedures and responsibilities in line with the respective standards, internal audits, executive monitoring and deï¬nition of objectives. The implementation of ISO 14001 in another four IUs and ISO 50001 in another one is currently ongoing, increasing the reach to 34% of the IUs. In addition, it is important to note the existence of an Energy Eï¬ƒciency Forum, which two or three times per year invites energy managers from the diï¬€erent BUs with a view to improving process performance and eï¬ƒciency. In 2018, this forum was held for the 29th and 30th times, involving the participation of over 60 employees.

SUSTAINA BILIT Y REP O RT â€”  129   5.2.1. Energy Corticeira Amorimâ€™s energy consumption, measured in gigajoules (GJ) increased in 2018 compared to 2017, in line with the increase in the companyâ€™s activity and integration of three new industrial units within the perimeter of the sustainability report. This is the result of the work implemented to date to increase the material dimension of the reported information. The energy mix remained practically unchanged, but there was a slight increase in the proportion of electricity used. 1, 62 7, 2 02  Total  1, 460, 011 1, 374, 002  4 11  Gasoline (GJ)  236 33 2  5 ,6 28  Propane (GJ)  9 ,3 3 9 7,4 5 0  26 ,5 21  Diesel (GJ)  22,70 3 21,73 3  58,254  Natural Gas (GJ)  73 ,0 5 0 74,161  4 8 5 ,272  Electricity (GJ)  4 10 ,73 8 3 9 1,3 9 2  1, 051, 116  Biomass (GJ)  2018 2017 2016  943, 946 878, 934  0  400,000  800,000  1,200,000  5.2.2.

Energy management system certiï¬cations â€“ ISO 50001 â€“ were renewed in the ï¬ve plants in the Cork Stoppers BU used as an implementation pilot with certiï¬cation underway for another plant in the Composite Cork BU. The adoption of this standard compels the establishment of systems and processes to improve energy performance and energy use and consumption, namely focusing on the more eï¬ƒcient use of the energy sources available while creating systematised work that is executed and adapted to other management systems underway. In total, â‚¬3.5 million was invested, resulting in an annual saving of over 212 thousand GJ.  130  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S.

Initiatives: Forty-ï¬ve operational and energy eï¬ƒciency measures were applied. One of the main measures was the installation of a high/ medium voltage substation with the improved operation of all the equipment dependent on it for energy. This project is part of the Lamas hub of the Cork Stoppers BU and covers three plants which share a production line. Results: The project makes annual savings in operational costs of roughly 20%, while providing improvements to the quality of energy supplied.  5.2.3.

The reasons for this increase were essentially the variation in the perimeter, the increase in business activity and the increase in the weight of electricity in the energy mix. Regarding electricity, similar to the consideration included in the 2016/2017 Sustainability Report, in order to align with the recommendations of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, developed by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute, in the present report, indirect energy emissions (scope 2) were calculated using the location-based method and the market-based method. Indirect energy emissions using the market-based method are: 64,735 t CO2 (2017: 54,792 t CO2, 2016: 41,485 t CO2). Information on scope 3 emissions is available in subchapter 2.4.3. Transport .  SUSTAINABILIT Y REP ORT â€”  131   CASE STUDY  5.2.4. Carbon Intensity 2018 Carbon Intensity (t CO 2 / Mâ‚¬ sales)  2017  2016  92.1*  88.9  89.5  * includes increase in perimeter; maintaining the same perimeter: 87.5  In 2018, despite the reduction seen in energy intensity, there was an increase in carbon intensity that essentially resulted in the higher share of electricity in the energy mix. A key contributing factor to this situation was the integration of three additional industrial units within the perimeter, which are undergoing a process of adjustment and adaptation to the processes in practice in the other plants. In comparison, the carbon intensity of Corticeira Amorimâ€™s activities saw a 2% reduction to 87,5 tons of CO2 per Mâ‚¬ of sales. The constant demand to implement production technologies and processes to ensure the optimisation of cork yield in the industrial cycle has led to a reduction in the availability of cork dust for energy purposes. This raises some challenges and drove investment in production systems to make it possible to produce the same amount of energy from less cork dust. In 2018, therefore, energy produced from biomass maintained its share of 65%, deemed CO2 neutral, of Corticeira Amorimâ€™s energy mix (65% in 2017 and 64% in 2016) and achieved 72 thousand tons of avoided CO2 emissions, as a result of the operational/energy eï¬ƒciency measures and the mix considered. Among the main initiatives in 2018, of note was the Composite Cork BUâ€™s project to improve the eï¬ƒciency of boilers.  Improved Boiler Eï¬ƒciency â€“ Burning and Heat Transfer (thermal ï¬‚uid) in the Composite Cork BU Objective: The lack of temperature stability in thermal ï¬‚uid and steam form at the industrial unit led to a considerable rise in gas use. The projectâ€™s aim was to improve the energy eï¬ƒciency of the boilers, ensuring temperature stability, raising the number of operating days of the main thermal ï¬‚uid boiler and ensuring the delivery of superheated steam. These measures reduced natural gas use and minimised emissions of incompletely burned particles, improving the environmental impact of the boilers. Initiatives: Work on the thermal ï¬‚uid and steam boilers. Results: Ã— Thermal ï¬‚uid temperature stability in the industrial unit; Ã— Increase of 63% in main boiler monthly working days; Ã— 10ÂºC lower set point temperature; Ã— Lower cork dust use; Ã— Over 100% higher steam delivery temperature; Ã— Lower electricity use with savings of around 146 tons of CO2; Ã— Lower compressed air use with savings of around 296 tons of CO2; Ã— 50% lower cleaning frequency; Ã— Lower use of natural gas.  132  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S.

The 2017 report, produced by United Nations Environment Programmeâ€™s International Resource Panel, shows that global materials use is accelerating â€“ it has more than tripled since 1970 and may double again up to 2050 â€“ and if resource use does not become more eï¬ƒcient, the Sustainable Development Goals will not be attained. As a 100% natural, 100% renewable and 100% recyclable product, cork is an excellent alternative to reduce global dependence on non-renewable products and lower the carbon footprint of ï¬nal products. Corticeira Amorim plays a proactive role in enlarging corkâ€™s already extensive applications, sustained by the materialâ€™s innate characteristics, which also stands out for its lightness, excellent insulation and consequent energy eï¬ƒciency.  5.3.1. Water Management and Use Water is an important natural resource that is key to human survival and the functioning of many industries. Climate change aï¬€ects the availability of fresh water and therefore economic growth, putting pressure on the global water supply. The lack of access to drinking water is a universal problem that is everyoneâ€™s responsibility. Water is especially important for the Raw Materials, Cork Stoppers and Insulation Cork BUs, responsible for the withdrawal of 86% of all water used by Corticeira Amorim. Public network water accounts for around 8% of all water collected, most of which is sourced from groundwater (92%). In 2018, water use rose by 5%, essentially due to variation in the perimeter. If the perimeter had remained the same, and despite the growth in activity, the rise would have been less than 1%, reï¬‚ecting Corticeira Amorimâ€™s eï¬€ort to manage water use eï¬ƒciently.

Initiatives: Implementation of a water saving system via the ï¬tting of ï¬‚ow restrictors on taps and showerheads and water-saving equipment on ï¬‚ushes. Results: The ï¬tting of ï¬‚ow restrictors on taps and showerheads reduced water use and energy to heat water by over 50%.  CASE STUDY Change to the Functioning of the WWTP at the Coruche Industrial Unit in the Raw Materials BU Objective: Due to a higher volume of water needing treatment after boiling the cork, the physical-chemical WWTP no longer had the necessary capacity and lost eï¬ƒciency. Simultaneously, the biological WWTP, which treated the water to wash the disks, was being under-utilised. The aim was to raise eï¬ƒciency in the treatment process by using the biological WWTP and: Ã— Raise the volume of liquid eï¬„uent treated; Ã— Lower the organic chemical compounds (OCCs) in liquid eï¬„uent; Ã— Lower WWTP chemical use; Ã— Move from 2 shifts to 1; Initiatives: In 2018, testing was undertaking on jointly treating two liquid eï¬„uents (physical-chemical, and biological) for the ï¬rst time in a physical-chemical WWTP and then in a biological WWTP, via decantation in the biological reactor. A centrifuge to remove sludge, the junction of the physical-chemical and biological processes, and the reduction of chemical products in 2019 are planned. Results: After the ï¬rst tests, OCCs fell by over 50% and coagulant and ï¬‚occulent use dropped. At the end of the project, it is foreseen that the daily treatment of eï¬„uent will be doubled.  134  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S. A .   5.3.2. Product Quality and Responsibility Cork is the bark of the cork oak tree. It is a natural raw material that is harvested, without harm, from the tree over a nine-year cycle and has a series of properties which make it unique. It is light, waterproof, elastic and compressible, thermally and acoustically insulating, burns slowly and is highly resistant to wear and tear. Moreover, it is totally biodegradable, renewable, recyclable, reusable and can be continually recirculated in the economy. Cork is an excellent eco-friendly alternative to high-impact non-renewable materials and, in a world in which innovation and ecology go hand in hand, it is creating interest in more and more sectors which are exploiting its characteristics, creating new products and solutions that also help society to adapt, mitigate or correct the impacts of climate change, the dwindling of resources and environmental erosion, leading to industryâ€™s transition to a low-carbon economy. Among the various projects implemented by Corticeira Amorim in this area, the following are of note: Ã— Development of 100% natural solutions (Cork Stoppers BU); Ã— Launch of WISE ï¬‚ooring solutions (Floor and Wall Coverings BU); Ã— Development of IMO-certiï¬ed primary decking solutions (Composite Cork BU); Ã— GreenURBANLIVING, an innovative cork solution for green faÃ§ades (Insulation Cork BU).

C IRCUL AR ECONOMY  0 Cork waste 478 tons of recycled cork 90% valorised residues According to the WBCSD â€“ World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the Circular Economy is a $ 4,5 trillion opportunity that oï¬€ers major potential for global economic growth and will also help society accelerate towards a sustainable future. Corticeira Amorim has identiï¬ed optimising the use and consumption of cork throughout the production cycle as a key strategy. By-products generated during the cork stopper production process and cork that does not meet production standards are used in other high added-value applications. Cork not suitable for use in such products is used as a source of energy in the form of biomass, deemed neutral in terms of CO2 emissions.  As a result, there is no wastage and no cork waste is generated â€“ no cork is lost and everything is used to generate value. Even the raw material generated by the maintenance of cork oak forests (pruning trimmings) is used in the production of ï¬‚oor and wall coverings and insulation cork solutions, as well as for a multiplicity of other purposes. The diagram below illustrates the cork transformation process adopted by Corticeira Amorim, and some of the applications resulting from its integral application, a paradigmatic case of the circular economy. Since cork is a material that promotes synergies with other materials, in addition to full use of cork, Corticeira Amorim uses by-products from other industries, whenever feasible, thereby saving the planetâ€™s natural resources and reducing the problems associated with their depletion . Within this framework, the main initiatives include the â€œCircular Economyâ€ project, implemented in the Composite Cork BU and various initiatives for selective collection and recycling of cork, which is noted in subchapter 5.4.1.

The development of composite materials, which incorporate by-products from various industries, beyond the world of cork, makes it possible to give life to new products for a wide range of applications in the most diverse business segments. The â€œcircular economyâ€ project consists of identifying and valuing these materials. Waste products generated by Amorim Cork Compositesâ€™ production operations are also incorporated into manufacturing processes. This circular economy model, complemented by other materials, covers several areas of the company, and focuses in particular on innovation, procurement and industrialisation, with the objective of valuing cork, using it in its optimal quantity, in combination with other materials. Initiatives: Ã— Deï¬nition of a strategy for large scale procurement and contracting of alternative raw materials; 140  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP ORT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MORIM , S.G.P.S., S. A .  Ã— Installation of a new grinding and agglomeration line; Ã— Identiï¬cation and implementation of new agglomeration processes; Ã— Development of new products / raw materials based on the circular economy. These products combine cork with other carbon neutral raw materials, raw materials with a negative carbon footprint, or by-products from other industries. Results: Ã— Identiï¬cation of more than 5 thousand tons of materials of potential interest; Ã— Higher than 180% increase in the consumption of this type of material; Ã— Increased eï¬ƒciency and production capacity by more than 260%; Ã— Development of a portfolio of new products based on the circular economy.   5.4.1. Recycling cork One of the environmental advantages of recycling cork lies in the fact that it incorporates carbon absorbed by the cork oak tree, which is held there throughout the corkâ€™s lifetime. Increasing the life cycle of cork through recycling delays the release of this carbon back into the atmosphere. Although not used in cork stoppers, recycled cork can have a second life and be used for a multiplicity of other purposes, extending its life cycle and the related environmental beneï¬ts. Cork stoppers and other cork products are collected, treated and ground at one of three Corticeira Amorim industrial units in Portugal licensed for recycling cork. After being processed into granules, it can be reintegrated into the production process and used to produce composite and insulation cork agglomerates. The company supports several initiatives for the selective collection and recycling of cork stoppers, a concept that originated in Portugal in 2008 with the launch of the Green Cork project, a partnership between Corticeira Amorim and Quercus, Portugalâ€™s leading environmental association. The project was subsequently extended to other countries, including Spain, the US, Canada, France, Italy, the UK, South Africa and Australia. In 2018, 478 tons of cork were recycled through the various programmes, corresponding to 87% stoppers and 13% other products. The main ongoing initiatives in 2018 are listed below, highlighting the campaign developed in 2018 with the Auchan Group in France.  Program  Description Implemented since 2008, Green Cork is a project managed by Quercus to collect cork stoppers for recycling. It is developed in partnership with Corticeira Amorim and several other partners. Its main objectives are to collect cork stoppers and finance the planting of native trees, through the Common Forest project. http://www.greencork.org/participe/ In operation since 2011, this initiative involves associations and institutions that mobilise around 1 000 volunteers and manage more than 5 000 collection points throughout Italy. For every ton of cork stoppers collected, a donation is made to institutions, thereby financing charity projects, while favouring the circular economy, giving a new lease of life to recycled cork. http://www.amorimcorkitalia.com/campagna-etico Launched in France in 2009 with the aim of strengthening customer relations allied to environmental protection and various charity institutions. Today it is the worldâ€™s biggest cork recycling initiative. http://www.ecobouchon.com/ The largest cork stopper recycling programme in North America, adopted in 2008 by the Canadian shoe company SOLE. The cork stoppers collected via the projectâ€™s network of more than 3 000 partners are forwarded to units that transform and subsequently incorporate them into the production of shoe soles produced by SOLE. https://recork.org/  Launched in 2013 in South Africa, this initiative aims to collect used or surplus cork stoppers to give them a new lease of life. https://www.amorimcork.co.za/about-cork/  SUSTAINA BILIT Y REP O RT â€”  141   CASE STUDY Cork Stopper Recycling Campaign with Auchan Objective: In partnership with the French retail chain Auchan, a recycling campaign was conducted that aimed to raise consumer awareness of the importance of recycling cork stoppers, while emphasising the excellent environmental credentials of this natural raw material. Initiatives: During the traditional Autumn Wine Fair, 641 stores in the Auchan chain in France have collected used cork stoppers, by encouraging their customers to take part in one of Franceâ€™s biggest cork recycling initiatives. Subsequently, the corks collected were delivered to Amorim France, which is responsible for forwarding them for recycling. Results: The cork oak tree is a biological carbon sink. Using its roots, leaves, trunk and bark â€“ i.e. cork â€“ to retain CO2 throughout its life cycle. Through recycling, this carbon retention capacity is prolonged. Since launch of the EcoBouchon programme in 2009, over 1 000 tons of cork stoppers have been collected and recycled in France. This recycling programme also has a social responsibility dimension: for every ton of corks collected, Auchan and Corticeira Amorim donate â‚¬300 to a charity.  5.4.2. Waste Corticeira Amorim does not consider cork dust as waste, but uses it as an energy resource. In 2018, 90% of the total waste generated by Corticiera Amorim was recycled by authorised agents and only 10% was eliminated.  2018  2017  2016  Hazardous Industrial Waste  373  282  249  Recovery  237  170  116  Disposal  135  112  134  10,059  8,544  9,559  Recovery  9,114  7,811  8,683  Disposal  945  733  876  10,432  8,826  9,808  Non â€“ Hazardous Industrial Waste  Total  (ton)  The company recognises the importance of recovering waste with a view to prolonging its useful life in the economy and reaping the associated beneï¬ts and has implemented work processes or technologies to reduce, recycle or reuse waste. In 2018, the most relevant examples of this practice are: the Recupera project of the Floor and Wall Coverings BU and the project to develop an underlay based on composites from the circular economy, in the Composite Cork BU. It is also important to note the existence of processes in the diï¬€erent manufacturing plants for labelling, storing, handling and transporting dangerous products.  142  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S. A .   CASE STUDY Recupera project by the Floor and Wall Coverings BU Objective: To incorporate cork waste in new composite cork products. In the production process of Amorim Revestimentos diï¬€erent product families, namely the cutting operation and creation of the locking system, â€œwasteâ€ is generated which, prior to the implementation of this project, had to be sent to landï¬lls. With the Recupera project, these surpluses are incorporated into the production processes of technical solutions, using composite cork. Initiatives: Ã— Separation of the surpluses resulting from the cutting operation (polymers vs natural ï¬bres); Ã— Treatment and classiï¬cation in order to be reintroduced into the production process; Ã— Incorporation of the waste with polymers into the processes of agglomerating cork composites with polymers (Subertech press); Ã— Incorporation of natural ï¬bres into the cork agglomeration processes. Results: Project currently underway aimed at incorporating 600 tons per year of cork composite waste in agglomeration processes using the Subertech press and 700 tons per year of natural ï¬bres in cork agglomeration processes.  CASE STUDY Development of Underlay Based on Composites from the Circular Economy by the Composite Cork BU Objective: The circular economy concept and the development of materials which, in addition to being recyclable, use recycled raw materials themselves are increasingly central issues in a competitive market with growing environmental concerns. With the aim of oï¬€ering diï¬€erentiating and sustainable products, Amorim Cork Composites developed an underlay with excellent acoustic and thermal performance. Using the optimal quantity of cork and combining it with other composites from the circular economy, it was possible to create a competitive product that meets the needs of the laminate ï¬‚ooring segment, which is currently the largest slice of the ï¬‚ooring market. Initiatives: Initially, there was identiï¬cation of, and procurement from, industries with the greatest potential for waste, as a source of complementary raw materials. After the existence of the raw material was ensured, there was internal development of the product: Ã— Deï¬nition of the requirements and identiï¬cation of the main market needs; Ã— Development of diï¬€erent iterations, combining cork with diï¬€erent composites in perfect balance until achieving the product that fully complies with all the initially chosen requirements; Ã— Performance of tests in accredited laboratories for product certiï¬cation; Results: The product is in full launch phase. The productâ€™s characteristics will contribute to bolstering a circular economy business model.

Labour Relations  22% Employees exercise the right to freedom of association 100% Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements between APCOR and the trade unions of the sector (Portugal) Freedom of association is a right of all Corticeira Amorim employees and is actively exercised by 22% of those covered by this report. To regulate working conditions in Portugal, collective labour contracts that cover 100% of employees are agreed on by APCOR and the trade unions that represent the sectorâ€™s workers. This agreement has covered topics such as work schedules, remuneration, access to training, among others. It is worth noting the ratio of 1.35 between the lowest wage agreed in the collective bargaining agreement (â‚¬ 775.51) and the national minimum wage. The diï¬€erent companies also have internal bodies that represent employees (trade union commissions, workersâ€™ commissions, occupational health and safety commissions) and participate in various aspects of the day-to-day life of the companies. In terms of labour relations, it should also be mentioned that the company awards salary bonuses and other supplements of a diï¬€erent nature, among other beneï¬ts. In particular employees have access to a hospitalisation insurance policy and workers in the units of the companyâ€™s head oï¬ƒce have access to curative medical consultations; support for the education of employees and their children, through the granting of school grants and merit scholarships to employeesâ€™ children; two extra days of vacation; recognition and celebratory initiatives throughout the year, that include oï¬€ering toys to the younger children of employees and Christmas baskets for all employees. There are also programmes implemented to monitor the organisational climate and internal communication plans, which are considered to be fundamental for the involvement and commitment of the employees in the companyâ€™s day-to-day activities and projects. The main initiatives include the organisational climate study carried out in the Raw Materials BU and the launch of the Linkpeople platform â€“ a digital platform that enables interactivity between managers and employees (in particular performance management) between employees and human resource management departments and even between employees. Â   CASE STUDY Study of the Organisational Climate at the Raw Materials BU Objective: Given the need to have an up-to-date portrait of the organisational climate, the Raw Materials BU conducted a study to discover employeesâ€™ opinions about their working environment and to understand their needs and expectations and the importance and value given to their working environment. Initiatives: Ã— Diagnosis: distribution of questionnaires to all employees, with voluntary involvement in the survey. The questionnaire addresses the most important aspects under climate surveys: communication, teamwork, relations with colleagues and bosses, salaries and recognition; Ã— Results analysis: data analysis, comparing the current situation with those in 2011 and 2014; Ã— Meeting with the direct bosses of each factory to disclose the results and create an action plan; Ã— Creating an action plan: after identifying the lower-scoring issues, an improvement plan was created. Results: After changes to the organisational model of the Raw Materials BU, various improvements were implemented in January 2017 with a positive impact on the organisational climate, as the study suggests. Included among the most signiï¬cant results are: Ã— A roughly 18% improvement in all the points obtained in every question compared to the last study in 2014, and over 27% compared to 2011; Ã— 97% of the questions have higher results relative to the previous survey; Ã— Increased positive responses in the questions on social/ sustainability responsibility; An action plan is currently underway aimed at continuing and improving all points, chieï¬‚y those with the lowest scores.

A .  Female  Male   In 2018, there was a signiï¬cant increase in training hours at Corticeira Amorim. This occurred across the board but focused in particular on production employees and technical and supervisory staï¬€. It should be highlighted that the project involved implementation of a new ERP (SAP) in the Raw Materials BU and involved a very high number of training hours. In addition to the technical aspects, the eï¬€ort being made to convert skills to raise the qualiï¬cations of the current workforce as far as possible must be stressed. The SAP implementation project that will be introduced successively across all Corticeira Amorim group companies by 2021 includes precisely a â€œmanagement of changeâ€ component with a concern to maximize the likely success of the process, both from the management and behavioural perspective. In addition to this, there is a constant concern to optimise current skills and to enhance the development of new skills and qualiï¬cations of current employees without calling the projectâ€™s conditions for success into question. The plans and actions implemented to upgrade occupational health and safety involved investment in training operators and management, contributing to upgrading skills and attitudes in this area. Also of note are the programmes for young employees (internships for young employees) and direct bosses that add a signiï¬cant amount to this total.  CASE STUDY â€œFrom Bark to Bottleâ€ Training Programme at the Cork Stoppers BU Objective: To promote a deeper knowledge of the business among the companyâ€™s employees via theoretical and practical training encompassing all the processes and products, from raw materials to markets and R&D+I, and enhancing peopleâ€™s involvement with the business and the organisational culture in the context of wine culture and sustainable development. Initiatives: A training programme with a heavy practical component developed in the IUs that includes modules on the choice of raw materials and natural stoppers. It is currently held twice a year, taught by 24 trainers including high-level directors, and, due to the proximity to the business, employees from the Raw Materials BU will also take part in the programme, both as trainers and trainees. Results: Dynamic in format, the training programme â€œFrom Bark to Bottleâ€ contributes to greater knowledge of the business, history and culture of the group, oï¬€ering a global vision and, simultaneously, an awareness of the groupâ€™s hierarchical structure. Equally, it boosts employeesâ€™ involvement with the company, conveying a passion for cork, throughout the organisation, and fostering contact with people, processes and products.  SUSTAINABILIT Y REP ORT â€”  149   6.1.4. Diversity, Equal Oppor tunities and Nondiscrimination Corticeira Amorim advocates people management and motivation policies that promote non-discrimination and equal opportunity in the recruitment, promotion and training of its employees, as well as in their remuneration and working conditions. The criteria of equity and promoting merit govern decisions in every situation, never factors based on gender, age, race or religion. Social realities and the gender imbalance found in certain roles and positions in diï¬€erent organisations and institutions is obviously transposed into the organisational reality of Corticeira Amorim, which was founded more than a century ago and is not detached from the context in which it operates. Corticeira Amorim bases its people management practices on evaluating merit and rewarding performance. The company does not restrict the access of women to any professional positions or categories, nor are increases in remuneration aï¬€ected by factors that are not based on skills and real performance. The ratios shown represent a positive change in gender equality. The companyâ€™s intervention in this area includes, in particular, communication and awareness initiatives for this key issue that currently faces our society and measures aimed at striking a healthy balance between work / family life.  6.1.5. Well-being of employees Corticeira Amorim provides employees with a series of beneï¬ts aimed at their well-being in addition to working time and which have a positive impact on reconciling personal and family life, namely: Ã— In health terms, most companies in Portugal provide, in addition to mandatory occupational health insurance, curative medicine with the possibility of consultations at least twice a week which is often the level at which various pathologies, including mental health, are ï¬rst diagnosed. In addition, there is a ï¬‚u vaccination programme for employees and various types of health screening (ophthalmology, cardiovascular, respiratory, etc.). The BUs also have agreements with clinical laboratories, which take samples at the companies, and pharmacies, which deliver medicines to the facilities; Ã— In educational terms, school subsidies are provided annually to all children of employees and student workers to support the purchase of school materials. In addition, it has introduced a scholarship programme for employeesâ€™ children to pay tuition fees for around 30 young people every year; Ã— The company canteens can be used by employeesâ€™ direct family members and employees may acquire meals to take home, thereby facilitating everyday life in some cases; Ã— Two additional days of holiday.

Many of these have serious consequences on workersâ€™ long-term ability to earn an income. Corticeira Amorim recognises that working conditions are one of the key factors in an organisationâ€™s success. This commitment to occupational health and safety (OHS) is evident in the established goal to reduce the number of accidents by more than 50% by 2020, in the investments made, in the continual review of safety plans and in the monitoring of their eï¬€ectiveness and adequacy to the risks, reiterating the focus on this theme via the staï¬€ commitment to speciï¬c targets in their personal goals contracts and in the awareness and training of all employees. On the subject of OHS, the BUs have implemented concrete measures, structured plans aimed at continual and sustained improvement of the practices and risk prevention, that reduce occurrences and mitigate the eï¬€ects, with a direct positive impact on the indicators in these areas. Corticeira Amorimâ€™s health and safety goal is for the physical, social and psychological well-being of employees to be a constant in all its companies. Its objectives in this area include:  UN SD G S AND TARGE TS  Good Health and Well-Being  Decent Work and Economic Growth  SDG 3.6 By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traï¬ƒc accidents. SDG 3.8 Achieve universal health coverage, including ï¬nancial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, eï¬€ective, quality and aï¬€ordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. SDG 3.d Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks. SDG 8.8 Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment.  Ã— Improve the risk assessment and implementation of health and safety at work; Ã— Improve the working conditions and well-being of its employees; Ã— Reduce the frequency of work accidents; Ã— Reduce the number of days lost due to accidents and occupational illnesses.

In line with these results, an overall reduction in the frequency index was seen. However, there was a rise in the rate of days lost due to certain accidents, which implied longer recovery periods. Since the end of 2017, Corticeira Amorim has implemented a plan to combat occupational accidents that encompasses various measures, namely the creation of a hygiene and safety at work forum composed of the OHS areas and by the general directors of each BU. This forum met four times in 2018, promoting discussion of the theme, benchmark results analysis and best practices. Bearing in mind all of the actions set out in the plan, it is believed that the results obtained will be even more visible and relevant in coming years. In the reporting period, there was a signiï¬cant rise in the occupational illness rate. The occurrence of new cases in 2018 was similar to previous years, but the noticeable worsening was due to the validation by oï¬ƒcial bodies of various pending processes and the swifter and more aï¬ƒrmative diagnosis of certain types of pathologies (e.g. tendinitis) as occupational illnesses. It is therefore also recognised that public occupational health services are more active and sensitive towards combating occupational illnesses. Absenteeism has remained relatively stable and 2018 was no exception. The recorded rise was due to a change in the basis of calculation according to the methodological notes. While not especially bad compared to the average for industrial companies in Portugal, this is an area where improvements are intended in coming years.  152  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S. A .  Corticeira Amorim complies with all legal requirements, norms and decisions aï¬€ecting OHS in every country in which it has operations. Good practices in this area include: Ã— Regulatory admission and periodical medical examinations in the workplace; Ã— Provision of personal protection equipment; Ã— Employee training in hygiene and safety adapted to the speciï¬c characteristics of each job; Ã— Training of all those involved in the working processes, including service providers; Ã— Hygiene and safety committees attended by employees and/ or employee representatives. Of note is the external international OHSAS ISO 18001 validation and certiï¬cation at one of the companyâ€™s units covering 14% of employees, which is intended to extend. ISO 45001 certiï¬cation is underway for another ï¬ve Corticeira Amorim IUs, raising coverage to more than 35% of employees. Workers are also oï¬€ered voluntary health programmes.   CASE STUDY Physical Activity Project in the Raw Materials BU Objective: Given a workplace accident record of 40%, causing absence due to musculoskeletal disorders, the aim was to develop and implement a physical activity programme among employees that could: Ã— Reduce workplace accidents; Ã— Improve employeesâ€™ physical condition; Ã— Correct incorrect posture and/or identify alternative ways of completing tasks; Ã— Reduce work-related musculoskeletal disorders and resulting occupational illnesses. Initiatives: A programme with the following components was developed: Ã— Ergonomic risk assessment by bodily area: a risk level is allocated for each task and by bodily area according to the breadth of movement, enforced posture, force and repetition; assessment of manual handling of loads; Ã— Assessment of the organisational and physical conditions of the job; diagnosis of the characteristics of the existing working equipment and tools, comparing and adapting them to the ergonomic principles of the anthropometric study of the Portuguese population; Ã— Assessment of the workerâ€™s personal physical condition to identify the bodily structures most requested for tasks, identifying over-used structures and disuse leading to inactivity and lower tolerance to exertion. Results: Ã— Improvement in the physical condition of almost 100% of employees, proven by the physical assessment indicators; Ã— Lower workplace accidents and musculoskeletal disorders (no consequence of this type after implementing the programme); Ã— Better team spirit; Ã— Boosted discipline and team organisation; Ã— General feeling among workers of the beneï¬ts of the programme.

With over 4 400 workers spread around the globe, Corticeira Amorim recognises the importance of being an active agent in aiding communities to overcome the challenges they face. Concern for social balance accompanies Corticeira Amorimâ€™s almost 150 years of operations. It was one of the ï¬rst companies to provide all workers with a canteen and a doctor as far back as 1938. Its concept of social responsibility is not limited purely to the strict circle of its workers, extending instead to the surrounding community, seeking to commit to this relationship too.

Natural Choice Programme The Natural Choice Programme, launched by Corticeira Amorim in 2008, with initiatives that are renewed annually, has as its main objectives: Ã— raise awareness among employees and society in general, as citizens responsible for future generations, of the need for social solidarity and for more environmentally friendly behaviour; Ã— ensure sustainable development practices are a positive factor of diï¬€erentiation among diï¬€erent stakeholder groups. a) Environmental education initiatives Collaboration with schools, from primary schools to business schools, in Portugal and abroad. Through sessions organised by employees at schools and school visits to the companyâ€™s facilities, more than 1 700 students participated in 2018 â€“ 800 in school environments and 934 in company environments.  CASE STUDY From the montado to the Cork Stopper Objective: The Municipality of Santarem, with support from Corticeira Amorim, has been promoting the information and environmental awareness campaign -â€From the montado to the Cork Stopperâ€ to primary and middle schools in the municipality. This initiative aims to arouse the interest of the school community for Portugalâ€™s native forest, revealing the cork forestâ€™s ecosystem and the importance of the exploitation of cork to ensure conservation of the forests. Initiatives: The initiative, which begins in January of each year, foresees that participating schools will collect cork stoppers for recycling, which are forwarded to the Green Cork programme, organised by Quercus, of which the municipality has been a partner since June 2016. The school that collects the largest number of cork stoppers per student, in a 3-month period, is rewarded with a study visit to the Cork and Cork Tree Observatory and a cork forest that is being harvested in Coruche, enabling the students to learn about a species that has high cultural, economic and environmental value. Results: More than 395 students from diï¬€erent schools took part in the initiative in 2018, thereby contributing to the Circular Economy.Â    b) Porto Futuro Programme Protocol with the Porto Municipal Council that supports the collaboration of Corticeira Amorim with a group of schools in the Portuguese city on transposing business practices to the schools:  CASE STUDY Decreased Consumption of Plastic Cups in the Cork Stoppers BU  Ã— â€œJunior Achievementâ€ volunteers â€“ entrepreneurship and ï¬nancial education â€“ participation of more than 100 volunteers since 2005; Ã— Presence at the General Councils of the School Group; Ã— Miscellaneous Projects; Ã— Donation of computer equipment, ï¬‚oor and wall coverings and insulation materials. Sponsorship of merit awards.  c) Sustainability Forum 2018 A diverse panel of experts was invited to the 2018 edition of Corticeira Amorimâ€™s Sustainability Forum, including ClÃ¡udia Coelho and Marta Antas Gago (PwC), Nuno Gaspar Oliveira (EsporÃ£o) and Aline Guerreiro (Portal da ConstruÃ§Ã£o SustentÃ¡vel) who discussed important concepts for the industry with employees â€“ such as the impact of the circular economy, trends and sustainability challenges and the value of ecosystem services. It was an opportunity to share key ideas for reï¬‚ection about the positive impact of sustainability in the cork industry, in particular in relation to forests and the construction industry.  Objective: Plastic is currently one of the major contaminants of the oceans, interfering with natural biodiversity and causing various imbalances on the planet. Although plastics used by Amorim Champcork are subsequently recycled, their manufacture and recycling consumes energy and causes CO 2 emissions, contributing to the imbalance of ecosystems. The objective of this initiative is to reduce the environmental footprint by reducing consumption of plastic cups in this IU. Initiatives: Amorim Champcork consumed more than 7 000 plastic cups a month, equivalent to almost 20 kg of plastic per month. On average, each person consumes 155 cups / year, representing a cost of approximately â‚¬1 000 for the unit / year plus the costs related to recycling. By assigning re-usable cups to all employees, the sleeves of plastic cup were removed from the drinks dispensers. Results: Although the useful life of the re-usable cups has not yet been determined, this measure has reduced the consumption of single-use plastic cups in the IU. In addition to reduction of the environmental footprint, this measure allows an eï¬€ective saving of around â‚¬ 2 000 per year.  d) Reforestation In line with initiatives organised in previous years, about 100 volunteers from Corticeira Amorim planted 2 000 cork oak trees in 2018. The initiative took place in the Monte da Torre estate, owned by Galveias Municipal Council. The initiative was carried out within the framework of the Common Forest project, which aims to create a native forest with high levels of biodiversity and production of ecosystem services, funded by Quercusâ€™ Green Cork â€“ cork stopper collection and recycling project â€“ of which Corticeira Amorim has been a partner since its launch. By means of this initiative, volunteers from Corticeira Amorim have contributed, since 2011, to the planting of 20 500 native trees in Portugal, the majority of which have been cork oak trees. e) Other initiatives The involvement of the company and employees is evident in several initiatives related to sustainability issues â€“ ranging from blood donation campaigns, organisation of sporting events, workshops and various competitions, participation in voluntary rehabilitation of school spaces, participation in humanitarian associations , internal campaigns for collecting books, food and clothing to be donated to social institutions, which require greater involvement with the Community and draw attention to social responsibility, healthy living and environmentally friendly lifestyles. Group companies also encourage the involvement of employees in the â€œBiological Gardensâ€ project, providing spaces within their premises for the cultivation of vegetable gardens.  SUSTAINABILIT Y REP ORT â€”  155   6.3.2. Sponsorship and Donations a) Donations Over the years Corticeira Amorim has continually pursued a policy of donating materials to institutions of recognised merit with a capacity for social intervention, a practice with an evident social value that helps improve the quality of the services provided by those institutions. In 2018, several institutions â€“ public, private and associative â€“ beneï¬ted from donations of a wide range materials (Corticeira Amorim products, oï¬ƒce supplies, computer equipment and other items). Corticeira Amorim is a leading donor to the Albertina Ferreira de Amorim Foundation, public utility entity, to promote charity initiatives and to foster the ethical, religious, cultural and civilisational aspects of human advancement. The Foundation acts in two primary areas: support for scientiï¬c research in the ï¬eld of cork raw materials, and humanitarian and social support for causes and projects in the communities surrounding Corticeira Amorim companies. In 2018, it was active in making social, humanitarian and life-supporting interventions through ï¬nancial support or donations in kind to about 40 institutions in the areas of social insertion, foster care, support for the elderly, ï¬re brigade corporations, hospital units and the Liga Portuguesa Contra o Cancro, among others. b) AcadÃ©mie Amorim This is a non-proï¬t organisation, made up of scientists dedicated to wine research, with the objective of optimising the quality of the wine and ensuring that its aging process proceeds as expected. Since 1992 this institution founded in France by members of the third generation of the Amorim family, supports the researchersâ€™ work by oï¬€ering them an annual scholarship that will reward the scientiï¬c work developed and contribute to improving knowledge about wine. In 2018, GrÃ©goire Henry & Tristan Destremau, with the VINOVAE project, were awarded the GRAND INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT PRIZE. In addition to recognising those who are dedicated to the study of wine and its environment, the Academy promotes thematic forums, to which it invites experts, and interested professionals who share the same passion for wine.  c) Other assistance Since Corticeira Amorim was founded, it has been a partner of the Bagos Dâ€™Ouro Association, an institution dedicated to supporting children and young people in need in the Douro region of Portugal. The Association provides assistance by supporting childrenâ€™s school careers and creating opportunities for developing successful lives. The company is also a founding partner of the Terras de Santa Maria Foundation. Corticeira Amorim is represented on the board of directors of this foundation and annually awards a prize to the best management student at Portugalâ€™s Instituto Superior Entre Douro e Vouga (ISVOUGA). The company also collaborates with numerous national and international initiatives, providing materials, know-how and technical support to the development of educational, research and artistic projects. In 2018, it collaborated with the following entities: Rhode Island School of Design (USA), Pratt Institute (USA), Elon University (USA), Copenhagen Contemporary (Denmark), Bonn Bundeskunsthalle Museum (Denmark), Domaine de Boisbuchet (France), Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation (Portugal) and Centro Cultural de BelÃ©m (Portugal).  156  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S.

E NERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE â€“ EMISSIONS  In the case of energy consumption by suppliers outside the organisation, and since there are no conversion factors in the bibliography that enable accurate data to be determined, Corticeira Amorim has estimated energy consumption, based on the value of emissions and emission factors of its own fuels, and several assumptions had to be made. For this reason, the calculation presented herein is an estimate. Corticeira Amorim aims to continue working to consolidate the methodology used. The ï¬gures presented, consider the most important aspects of Corticeira Amorimâ€™s value chain, for its activity in Portugal (excluding Socori, S.A.).  In order to calculate CO2 emissions, the conversion factors used in the SGCIE audits were considered. In the case of emissions associated with electricity consumption (market-based method), the report used information available at the time of writing from the supplier Endesa. Emissions outside Portugal were considered to be of marginal material importance (about 7%):  In this context, the following activities and assumptions were considered:  64.1  Natural Gas (kg CO 2 /GJ)  63  Propane (kg CO 2 /GJ)  74  Diesel (kg CO 2 /GJ)  69.2  Gasoline (kg CO 2 /GJ)  0  Biomass (cork powder) (kg CO 2 /GJ) Biomass (other) (kg CO2/GJ)  Ã— Upstream and downstream transport and distribution: the quantity of product bought and sold was considered, which corresponds to 95% of the total; emission factors associated with the transportation of products by sea, air and / or road;  0  Electricity â€“ 2016 supplier (g CO 2 /kWh) Electricity â€“ 2017 supplier (g CO 2 /kWh)  480.24  Electricity â€“ 2018 supplier (g CO 2 /kWh) *  480.24  Electricity â€“ location: Portugal (g CO 2 /kWh)  Ã— Residues generated in operations: the total waste produced and the waste sent to the respective recipients were considered; emission factors associated with road transport per ton transported;  381.58  470.00  *information available to date  7.6. E NERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE â€“ ENERGY INTENSIT Y AND CARBON INTENSIT Y  Ã— Business trips: emission ï¬gures calculated by the travel agency; Ã— Transport of employees: the distance travelled by employees was measured; emission factor associated with road transport by the distance travelled by employees between home-work-home. The source of information for all the emission factors was the factors published by the GHG Protocol and Defra â€“ Department for Environment, Food & Rural Aï¬€airs. 7.3. E CONOMIC PERFOR MANCE The amounts presented refer to Corticeira Amorimâ€™s consolidated values (100% of the companies included). Revenues correspond to the sum of the following items: sales and provision of services; supplementary income; operating subsidies; own works; other operating income; ï¬nancial income and gains; capital gains from real-estate (after deducting capital losses). Operating costs do not include depreciation. Investment in the community includes only the value of donations in cash and does not include contributions and donations in kind.  The diversity of Corticeira Amorimâ€™s applications and businesses makes it diï¬ƒcult to deï¬ne an indicator that clearly shows the evolution of CO2 emissions in relation to activity levels. Over time, eï¬€orts have been made to respond to this need by analysing diï¬€erent indicators and in recent years the company has opted for the ratio of emissions to the value of total sales. This indicator involves some limitations, namely those related to the diï¬€erences between the perimeter considered in the numerator (more restricted) and the perimeter considered in the (broader) denominator. These become more evident in years when there have been material changes in the perimeter of companies under consideration. To maintain the comparability of the indicator, the eï¬€ect of the acquired companies that are not part of the sustainability perimeter is excluded, in the calculation of the energy intensity and carbon intensity of activities in 2018, with the consolidated sales value considered for that year being â‚¬753 million. 7.7. H EALTH AND SAFET Y AT WORK The procedure for calculating the frequency index, the rate of occupational illnesses and the rate of lost days was changed according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Code of Practice. The formulas considered are as follows: Ã— Frequency index = Number accidents/ Hours of work x 1,000,000.  7.4. E NERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLIMATE CHANGE â€“ ENERGY In 2018, use was made of the conversion factors used in audits within the framework Energy Intensive Consumption Management System (SGCIE), ministerial order 17313/2008: Natural Gas (GJ/1000m 3)  37.9  Propane (GJ/t)  42.8  Gasoline (GJ/t)  44.5  Biomass (cork powder) (GJ/t)  15.7  Ã— Lost Days Rate = Number of days lost/ Hours of work x 1,000 000.  46.7  Diesel (GJ/t)  Ã— Occupational illness rate = Number of cases of occupational diseases/ Hours of work x 1,000,000.  Biomass (other) (GJ/t) Electricity (GJ/kWh)  11.6 0.0036  Ã— Absenteeism rate = Days of absence/Potential days of work. There was also a change in the formula for calculation of potential days, in which the accounting of holidays was eliminated, which led to a 17% reduction in the number of potential days, with a direct eï¬€ect on the absenteeism rate. For the calculation of the frequency index, only the accidents that give rise to lost days are considered. To determine the number of days lost, the number of workdays is considered. Counting begins the day after the accident occurs and stops when the employee returns to work.  158  â€” ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REP O RT â€˜18 CORTICEIR A A MO RIM , S.G.P.S., S. A .
